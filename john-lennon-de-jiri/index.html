  <p>1980年的12月8日晚上10：50，Mark David Chapman 用一把 .38 口径的枪朝
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon">John Lennon</a>
开了五枪，其中三发打中了 Lennon 的手臂和背部。鲜血直流的 Lennon
在警察赶来问他的身份时说了一生中最后的一句话：“I&rsquo;m John Lennon of the
Beatles.”。<br />
在送到罗斯福医院后，Lennon
因为流失了将近80％的血液，于晚上11点停止了心跳。这时，医院里面正在播放的音乐是
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">Beatles</a> 的“All My Loving”。</p>

<p>其中最喜欢的五首歌歌词如下：</p>

<p><strong>Love</strong></p>

<blockquote>
Love is real, real is love\
Love is feeling, feeling love\
Love is wanting to be loved\
Love is touch, touch is love\
Love is reaching, reaching love\
Love is asking to be loved

Love is you\
You and me\
Love is knowing\
We can be

Love is free, free is love\
Love is living, living love\
Love is needing to be loved
</blockquote>
**Jealous Guy**

<blockquote>
I was dreaming of the past\
And my heart was beating fast\
I began to lose control\
I began to lose control\
I didn't mean to hurt you\
I'm sorry that I made you cry\
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you\
I'm just a jealous guy

I was feeling insecure\
You might not love me anymore\
I was shivering inside\
I was shivering inside

I didn't mean to hurt you\
I'm sorry that I made you cry\
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you\
I'm just a jealous guy

I didn't mean to hurt you\
I'm sorry that I made you cry\
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you\
I'm just a jealous guy

I was trying to catch your eyes\
Thought that you was trying to hide\
I was swallowing my pain\
I was swallowing my pain

I didn't mean to hurt you\
I'm sorry that I made you cry\
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you\
I'm just a jealous guy, watch out\
I'm just a jealous guy, look out babe\
I'm just a jealous guy
</blockquote>
**Happy Xmas (War Is Over)**

<blockquote>
(Happy Xmas Kyoko\
Happy Xmas Julian)

So this is Xmas\
And what have you done\
Another year over\
And a new one just begun\
And so this is Xmas\
I hope you have fun\
The near and the dear one\
The old and the young

A very Merry Xmas\
And a happy New Year\
Let's hope it's a good one\
Without any fear

And so this is Xmas\
For weak and for strong\
For rich and the poor ones\
The world is so wrong\
And so happy Xmas\
For black and for white\
For yellow and red ones\
Let's stop all the fight

A very Merry Xmas\
And a happy New Year\
Let's hope it's a good one\
Without any fear

And so this is Xmas\
And what have we done\
Another year over\
A new one just begun\
And so happy Xmas\
We hope you have fun\
The near and the dear one\
The old and the young

A very Merry Xmas\
And a happy New Year\
Let's hope it's a good one\
Without any fear\
War is over, if you want it\
War is over now

Happy Xmas
</blockquote>
**Give Peace A Chance**

<blockquote>
Ev'rybody's talking about\
Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism\
This-ism, that-ism, is-m, is-m, is-m.

All we are saying is give peace a chance\
All we are saying is give peace a chance

C'mon\
Ev'rybody's talking about Ministers,\
Sinisters, Banisters and canisters\
Bishops and Fishops and Rabbis and Pop eyes,\
And bye bye, bye byes.

All we are saying is give peace a chance
</blockquote>
**Imagine**

<blockquote>
Imagine there's no heaven\
It's easy if you try\
No hell below us\
Above us only sky\
Imagine all the people\
Living for today...\
Imagine there's no countries\
It isn't hard to do\
Nothing to kill or die for\
And no religion too\
Imagine all the people\
Living life in peace...

You may say I'm a dreamer\
But I'm not the only one\
I hope someday you'll join us\
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions\
I wonder if you can\
No need for greed or hunger\
A brotherhood of man\
Imagine all the people\
Sharing all the world...

You may say I'm a dreamer\
But I'm not the only one\
I hope someday you'll join us\
And the world will live as one
</blockquote>
